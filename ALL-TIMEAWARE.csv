He graduated from medical school at the University of Pennsylvania in 1824. After practicing medicine for only a year, Bird turned his attention to a career in literature. Beginning his literary career at the <em>Monthly Magazine </em>of Philadelphia, Bird's best known work, 1831's <em>The Gladiator</em>, was produced on the stage by his good friend Edwin Forrest. Bird married Mary Mayer in 1837 and had a son, Frederick, just a year later. After writing other plays such as <em>Orralloosa</em> and <em>The Broker of Bogota</em>, Bird turned to writing novels, some of his better known works being <em>Cavalar</em> and <em>Nick of the Woods</em>. In the 1840s, Bird returned to medicine as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. He later tried his hand in photography, yet another creative side, in the 1850s before dying on January 23, 1854.</p>","Philadelphia, PA",Philadelphia County,,"<a href=""https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/?f[all_authors_facet][]=Bird%2C+Robert+Montgomery%2C+1806-1854"" target=""_blank"">PSU Catalog Link</a>","<a href=""https://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/literary-cultural-heritage-map-pa/bios/Bird__Robert_Montgomery"" target=""_blank"">Expanded Biography</a>",https://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biosimages/Bird__Robert_Montgomery.jpg,40.003889,-75.1875,Photo Credit: Albert Newsam.

De Camp was born in New York on November 27, 1907, and began his science fiction career in the 1930s (of the generation that included Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, and A. E. van Vogt). De Camp was concerned with entertaining the reader, and as a result his science fiction rarely achieved great psychological or sociological depth. During his later years, most of his fiction was concentrated in the fantasy field through his work of editing and expanding upon the Conan stories of Robert E. Howard. De Camp died on November 6, 2000, in Plano, Texas.</p>","Philadelphia, PA",Philadelphia County,,"<a href=""https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/?f[all_authors_facet][]=De+Camp%2C+L.+Sprague+(Lyon+Sprague)%2C+1907-2000"" target=""_blank"">PSU Catalog Link</a>","<a href=""https://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/literary-cultural-heritage-map-pa/bios/de_Camp__Lyon_Sprague"" target=""_blank"">Expanded Biography</a>",https://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biosimages/deCamp__Lyon_Sprague.jpg,40.035962,-75.349316,Photo Credit: Cimon Avaro.

Alexander K.

Despite the lack of a formal education, McClure had a distinguished career as both a journalist and a politician. In 1852, McClure purchased the Chambersburg <em>Franklin Repository </em> and used it to gain notoriety around Harrisburg. This notoriety helped him gain momentum for a political career and in 1857 he was elected to Pennsylvania's House of Representatives. McClure, along with Andrew G. Curtin, played a vital part in swinging state support to Abraham Lincoln during the Presidential election of 1860. Later in his life, McClure traveled out West and his book <em>Three Thousand Miles Through the Rocky Mountains</em> (1869) was used by many as a guide to the West. In 1875, McClure returned to Philadelphia where he started <em>The Philadelphia Times </em> and served on the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court. He died on June 6, 1909, on a farm in Wallingford, Pennsylvania.</p>","Sherman's Valley, PA",Perry County,,"<a href=""https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/?f[all_authors_facet][]=McClure,+Alexander+K.+(Alexander+Kelly),+1828-1909"" target=""_blank"">PSU Catalog Link</a>","<a href=""https://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/literary-cultural-heritage-map-pa/bios/McClure__Alexander_Kelly"" target=""_blank"">Expanded Biography</a>",https://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biosimages/McClure__Alexander_Kelly.jpg,40.365817,-77.346933,Photo Credit: Photograph of Alexander K.
