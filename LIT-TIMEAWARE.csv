Despite the lack of a formal education, McClure had a distinguished career as both a journalist and a politician. In 1852, McClure purchased the Chambersburg <em>Franklin Repository </em> and used it to gain notoriety around Harrisburg. This notoriety helped him gain momentum for a political career and in 1857 he was elected to Pennsylvania's House of Representatives. McClure, along with Andrew G. Curtin, played a vital part in swinging state support to Abraham Lincoln during the Presidential election of 1860. Later in his life, McClure traveled out West and his book <em>Three Thousand Miles Through the Rocky Mountains</em> (1869) was used by many as a guide to the West. In 1875, McClure returned to Philadelphia where he started <em>The Philadelphia Times </em> and served on the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court.
